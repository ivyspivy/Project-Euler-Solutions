# Project-Euler-Solutions

Project Euler Solutions from 3 years ago to the present. May or may not fix the earlier solutions to not have pasted in inputs; when I started out I did not know how to read from files. Problems 1-10 were done when I was learning on codeHS (not any type of mainstream language), and problems 25 and 26 were done by hand. Problems 54 and before (and 67) were done mainly in the summers of 2015 and 2016, and you can see my coding style evolution through them. Now I have less free time to spend on this project. The most recent problems solutions come with comments and thorough explanation.
