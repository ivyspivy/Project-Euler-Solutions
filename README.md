# Project-Euler-Solutions

Project Euler Solutions from 2 years ago to the present. May or may not fix the earlier solutions to not have pasted in inputs; when I started out I did not know how to read from files. Problems 1-10 were done when I was learning on codeHS (not any type of mainstream language), and problems 25 and 26 were done by hand. Apologies for the lack of explanation for any of these solutions, I may or may or may not go back and fix them. Problems 54 and before (including 67) were before college, now I have less free time to spend on this project. From time to time I can come up with solutions w/ explanations.
